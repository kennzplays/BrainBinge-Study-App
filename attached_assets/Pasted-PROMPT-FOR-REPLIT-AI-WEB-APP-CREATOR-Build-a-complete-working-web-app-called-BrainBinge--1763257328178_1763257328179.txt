PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI (WEB APP CREATOR):

Build a complete, working web app called “BrainBinge”.

🔹 Goal

BrainBinge is a study + quiz web app that:

Lets users choose or enter a subject

Generates quiz questions based on what the user types

Gives a breakdown/explanation of a topic

Has a simple XP system to gamify learning

Supports LaTeX rendering for math problems

I want it to run immediately in Replit as a web app.

🔹 Tech Stack & Structure

Use:

Backend: Python + Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

Math rendering: Include MathJax (or KaTeX) on the frontend so any LaTeX in questions or explanations renders properly.

Files:

app.py – Flask server

templates/index.html – main page

static/style.css – blue/white styling

static/script.js – client-side logic

requirements.txt – include flask

Everything should be ready to run in Replit once I click Run.

🔹 Core UI Requirements

On the main page:

Subject selection area with:

A row of buttons for common subjects:

“Math”, “English”, “Science”, “History”, “Programming”

PLUS an input for custom subject:

A text box labeled “Custom subject”

If the user types something here, it overrides the buttons.

Topic / concept input:

A text area where the user describes what they want help with
(e.g., “factoring quadratics”, “mitosis”, “thesis statements”).

Two main action buttons (two modes):

Button 1: “Generate Quiz Questions”

Button 2: “Breakdown + Quiz”

Output area:

A section where generated content appears (explanations and questions).

It must render LaTeX via MathJax so math shows up correctly.

XP system display:

Show current XP at the top or side, e.g., “XP: 120”

Display a simple progress bar or level text, e.g., “Level 3 – Study Striker”.

🔹 Behavior & Logic
1) Subject selection

Clicking a subject button sets the active subject.

If the user types into the Custom subject box, treat that as the subject instead of the button.

Make the active subject visually highlighted.

2) Button 1 – “Generate Quiz Questions”

When the user clicks “Generate Quiz Questions”:

Use:

Selected/typed subject

The topic/concept text

Send this to the backend (Flask) where you call the AI model (use OpenAI or a stub function if you can’t call external APIs).

The backend should generate quiz questions only, no long explanation:

5–7 questions

If the subject is Math, use LaTeX syntax (like x^2 + 3x + 2 = 0) where appropriate, so MathJax will render it.

Return questions (and answers) in a structured format.

On the frontend:

Display:

A heading: “Quiz Questions”

Each question on its own line or card

An “Answers” toggle or section underneath

Make sure LaTeX is wrapped in \( ... \) or $$ ... $$ so MathJax renders it.

After generating a quiz, award XP, e.g.:

+10 XP for each quiz generation.

Update XP on screen and visually animate or highlight the change.

3) Button 2 – “Breakdown + Quiz”

When the user clicks “Breakdown + Quiz”:

Use subject + topic and call the backend.

The backend should:

Generate a clear breakdown/explanation of the topic in small sections (like a mini-lesson).

At the end of the explanation, also generate 3–5 quiz questions based on that breakdown.

Example structure returned by backend:

Section 1: Short intro

Section 2: Step-by-step explanation

Section 3: Key points / summary

Section 4: Quiz questions + answers

On the frontend:

Display the breakdown first with headings:

“Concept Breakdown”

“Key Points”

“Quiz Questions”

LaTeX in the breakdown or questions should be rendered by MathJax.

Also award XP:

e.g. +15 XP for doing a breakdown + quiz.

4) XP System Details

Store XP in the browser using localStorage so if the user refreshes, their XP persists.

XP rules (simple):

+10 XP when “Generate Quiz Questions” is used successfully.

+15 XP when “Breakdown + Quiz” is used successfully.

Level calculation:

For example: level = floor(XP / 50) + 1

Display: “Level X – Title”

Add a simple title per level (hardcode a few):

Level 1: “Brain Rookie”

Level 2: “Study Starter”

Level 3: “Quiz Grinder”

Level 4+: “Brain Binger”

Show this near the XP bar.

🔹 Style & Theme (Blue + White)

In style.css, use:

Main colors:

Primary: different shades of blue

Background: light/white gradient or white with light blue accents

Text: dark navy or black for readability

Design guidelines:

Clean, modern layout

Rounded buttons and cards

Hover effects for subject buttons and action buttons

Make the app responsive enough to look okay on smaller screens.

🔹 LaTeX / MathJax Integration

Include MathJax in index.html via CDN.

After inserting new content into the output area (questions, breakdown), call the appropriate MathJax render function so any \( ... \) or $$ ... $$ content is converted to math.

Ensure both the breakdown and quiz questions can contain LaTeX.

🔹 Backend Implementation Notes

In app.py:

Create Flask routes:

GET / → render index.html

POST /generate_quiz → accept JSON or form data, return generated quiz questions

POST /breakdown_quiz → accept subject + topic, return breakdown + quiz

If you can call the OpenAI API, do so; otherwise, build a stub that returns example data in the right format so the app still works.

🔹 Final Requirement

The final Replit project must:

Run by starting app.py

Open to a single-page BrainBinge UI

Allow:

Subject selection (buttons + custom)

Topic input

Clicking Generate Quiz Questions OR Breakdown + Quiz

Seeing XP increase and level update

Displaying math content with LaTeX rendering

Generate all the code and files needed so I can use this immediately in Replit with no missing pieces.
